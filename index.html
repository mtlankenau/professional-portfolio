                        Welcome to my professional portfolio webpage!  My name is Michael Lankenau and I am currently a web developer in training, enrolled in the University of Richmond's coding bootcamp.
                    <br /> <br />
                        I am a 27 year old graduate from the Unversity of Virginia, who has been working in the environmental sciences industry for the past 4-5 years.  I am hoping to use the material I learn from the coding bootcamp to either transition into a more technicial role within the environmental sciences industry or to change career paths entirely as a web developer.
                    <br /> <br />
                        My goal is to use this webpage as a medium to showcase the coding skills that I have learned thus far.  I plan to update the layout and styling of this webpage progressively and hope to have more specific projects to showcase for you all in the future.
                    <br /> <br />
                        Now that you know more about myself and my goals, please enjoy the rest of my portfolio page!
